# tic_cross_game_c
A command-line game in C similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, but built with my own logic and a unique twist: - Uses 't' (tick) vs 'c' (cross) instead of traditional X and O. - Computer plays against the user with basic strategy and random fallback. - Developed entirely from scratch in 2 hours.
